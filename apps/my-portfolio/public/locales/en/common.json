    "name": "Nikita Bryliov",
    "title": "About Me",
    "paragraph1": "I am a full-stack software developer with over 6 years of professional experience, fluent in English and a native Russian speaker. My career spans a variety of roles—from building intelligent CV parsing systems and secure OAuth-based authentication platforms, to developing scalable backend services and interactive frontends in technologies like React, Flask, Docker, Java, and MySQL. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Waterloo and have worked with international companies including SAP, TextNow, Trustwave, and startups across Canada and Russia. I'm passionate about delivering high-quality, efficient solutions and enjoy tackling complex challenges in both frontend and backend environments.",
    "paragraph2": "Outside of work, I enjoy playing guitar, learning new languages, and building personal projects in Web3 and game development using Godot. I am currently based in Moscow and actively seeking full-time opportunities, but I also offer private English lessons and speaking practice for individuals looking to improve their language skills with a fluent communicator."
